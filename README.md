# Diabetes_Prediction_IS_ZeroTrustSecurity
We built a Diabetes Prediction System using ML to assess diabetes risk. To protect sensitive health data, we applied Zero Trust Security (ZTS), enforcing continuous authentication, microsegmentation, real-time monitoring, and end-to-end encryptionâ€”ensuring only verified users access the system.
